# Big Warden

January 15th, 2021 - Full Install: ~37GB.

## OVERVIEW

This ReadMe is designed to help you with the last few finishing steps necessary to enjoy Big Warden as I personally enjoy it. 

## GOALS


-  Put the finishing touches on your Big Warden installation

-  Get you playing the game as quickly as possible

## SPECIFICATIONS

- Due to the way .DAZIPs work, you will need to follow a few instructions before you're completely ready. Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit, so long as you're capable of following instructions.

## First off, you will need:

-   A clean, fresh, and LEGAL Steam installation of Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition (note: I am using this on Steam, and am unsure if this will work with Origin. It DOES require all of the DLC, so Ultimate Edition is likely required.)

## Install Dragon Age: Origins Ultimate Edition

- This part is self-explanatory. You'll want to go to the installation of the game, and remove all files present in the install folder (For example, steamapps/common/Dragon Age Origins). 

- Once done, go ahead and re-install it. This ensures that any installs you have will be totally clean, which is important for the next steps. 

- While you're here, run the game once, and choose "Configure". Then, in the Video Settings, choose whichever options you desire. (I maxxed mine out with a 16:9 display, and to skip the intro movies)

Install Big Warden via Wabbajack
-----------------------------------------

1.  Simply open the Wabbajack UI, which can be acquired from here if you don't already have it: <https://www.wabbajack.org/#/>. 

2.  Once you've installed Wabbajack, or if you already have it, open it up and choose "Browse Modlists". 

3.  From there, you will download "Big Warden" by clicking the little down arrow. 

4.  After that, you will choose an installation folder (I recommend something like "D:/Big Warden", substituting D: for any drive available.) This CANNOT be where Wabbajack.exe is located, nor your Dragon Age Origins folder.

5.  Downloads will auto-populate for you, but you can change that location if you so choose. 

6.  From there, just click the "play" button and let it do the rest.

Copy over the LAA Patched EXE (Steam users only)
------------------------------------------------

1. After the installation has completed, navigate to your Big Warden installation folder

2. Open the folder labeled "Game Folder Files"

3. Inside of this folder will be a copy of the Dragon Age: Origins EXE that has been patched to use 4GB of memory. Copy this exe to your steamapps/common/Dragon Age Ultimate Edition/bin_ship folder. Overwrite when prompted.

Install the remaining DAZIPs
---------------------------------

1. Upon finishing the Big Warden installation, navigate to steamapps/common/Dragon Age Ultimate Edition/bin_ship

2. Click on the program titled DAUpdater.exe

3. Choose "Select DAZIPs", and navigate to your Big Warden installation folder. 

4. There, inside of Game Folder Files, will be 8 DAZIPs that you will need to install using the DAUpdater. Simply select them, and they should appear in DAUpdater.

5. Select all of the DAZIPs within DAUpdater, and choose "Install Selected".

6. Wait for all of them to read "installed". Afterwards, you may close the program. 

7. See the bottom of this ReadMe for instructions to make Awakening in the OC work for you. Believe me, it's worth it.

# Finishing up Awakening in the OC (Note: GOG users will use GOG Galaxy paths (GOG Galaxy\Games\Dragin Age Origins) and Steam users (steam\steamapps\common\Dragon Age Ultimate Edition) instead of (Game_Install_Location))
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Find the equivalent of your "(Game_Install_Location)\packages\core_ep1\data" directory.

2. Copy all of the .erf files found there.

3. Find the "Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\AddIns\gxa_res_to_core\core\data" directory.

4. Paste the copied .erfs into that folder.

5. Find the equivalent of your "(Game_Install_Location)\packages\core_ep1" directory.

6. Copy the texture folder.

7. Paste the copied folder into the "Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\AddIns\gxa_res_to_core\core" directory.

8. Find the equivalent of your "(Game_Install_Location)\packages\core_ep1\audio\sound" directory.

9. Copy the three vfx_spells files.

1. Paste them into the "Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\AddIns\gxa_res_to_core\core\audio\sound" directory (create it if it doesn't exist).

1. Activate the 'Awakening in the OC' Addon via the Downloadable Contents menu in-game once you've launched it later on.

12. Find the equivalent of your "(Game_Install_Location)\packages\core_ep1\patch" folder

13. Copy the .erf file found there to the "Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age\AddIns\gxa_res_to_core\core\override" directory.

Install Dragon Age Redesigned
--------------------------------

1. Navigate to your Big Warden installation folder, then find and open ModOrganizer.exe

2. In the top right corner, you will see a drop-down menu next to the play button, which will start with "Dragon Age Redesigned Version 7.3c" selected. If not, select it from the drop-down.

3. Click "Run", and start by installing Dracomies True Textures. Do not change any paths, as it is already set to extract to the correct mod folder. 

4. Once done, run "Dragon Age Redesigned Version 7.3c", this time installing the NPC textures (i.e. Not Dracomies). You have three options to choose from, but I typically go with "Recommended". You may choose whichever you prefer.

5. Next up, go through the different installers for the party: Leliana, Morrigan, Oghren, Sten, Wynne, and Zevran. You may choose any options here you prefer, EXCEPT for Darkkami Zevran. Comparison images will be located in the ZIP files for each character, present in downloads. I typically go with lore options, and Leliana Version 11.

6. Finally, the final installers will be for the expansions. Do those as well, if you so choose. 

7. Once you have finished these, double-click on the Dragon Age Redesigned mod in the left pane and make sure there are multiple files there. If you only see Meta, let me know.

## Starting the game

Once you've finished installing the DAZIPs, Awakening in the OC, and Dragon Age Redesigned, and assuming you followed the order present in this readme, you should have Mod Organizer opened already. If so, simply choose Dragon Age Origins from the dropdown menu in the top right, and click "Play" to begin your adventure. If you DIDN'T follow the order in the readme, then simply open Mod Organizer and do the exact same thing. 

### If using Steam and, upon loading the game, the "other campaigns" button is darkened, exit the game, navigate to steamapps\common\Dragon Age Ultimate Edition\redist, and run DAOU_UpdateAddinsXML_Steam.exe. This should pull all of your addins into the game. 

## Mods to be aware of

- Skip the Fade/ Skip Ostagar - These mods do as written, and warrant no further explination. If you would rather not skip these, disable them at the bottom of Mod Organizer.
(NOTE: Some people have had issues when skipping Ostagar where the tutorial attempts to force them to select Alistair when he is not in the party. If you plan to skip Ostagar, be sure to disable tutorials, just in case)

- DABIK - 1440p cutscenes for better pre-rendered goodness. There is a 4K option, but I went with 1440 to make sure it was more accessible.

- Awakening in the OC - This is THE big one. This mod pulls in skills, talents, and abilities from Awakening into the base game. It also raises the level cap to 35. An amazing mod that's bound to be fun for everyone.
